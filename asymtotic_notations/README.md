* Getting a time function in some form, which cannot be simplefied in terms of n directly then time complexity cannot be mentioned. This approximation will be lower value(omega) or higher value(big-o). Exact value is theta. These notations are lower bound, upper bound and tight bound respectively

* Maximum value of lower bound is omega(2^n), upper bound is O(n2^n) and tight bound is theta(n2^n)
