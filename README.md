### Data Structures and algorithms in C and C++

* This repo contains data structures and algorithms in C and C++

* The way data is organized in the main memory during execution time of a program is called data structure

* Types of data structure:
    1. Physical data structure: Arrays, Matrices and linked list

    2. Logical data structure: Stack, Queue, Trees, Graph and Hashing

* C language doesn't have built in data structure
