* Criteria for analysing sorts:
        1. No.of comparisions
        2. No.of swaps
        3. Adaptive
        4. Stable
        5. Extra memory

* Preserving the order of duplicates in the sorted list is called stable algorithm. If there are duplicate numbers, then their name should be in sorted order. For other elements, numbers will be in sorted order and not names. Because both are not possible always

* Bubble, insertion and selection takes o(n2) time
