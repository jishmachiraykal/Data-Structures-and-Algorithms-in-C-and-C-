* Tree is a collection of nodes(vertices) and edges(the links). If there are n nodes, then n-1 edges

* Main node is root and other nodes are arranged in disjoint subsets. Each subset is tree again

* Decesendents are those set of nodes which can be reached from particular or under that node

* Ancestors: for any node the path along from that node to root node are ancestors

* Degree of a node: number of direct children it is having. Degree of a tree is minimum 3

* External/leaf/terminal nodes: Nodes with degree zero

* Internal/non-leaf/non-terminal nodes: Nodes with degree greater than 0

* Level starts from 1 onwards. Nodes are considered

* Height starts from 0. Edges are considered

* Forest: Collection of trees

* Binary tree: a tree of maximum degree 2 i.,e deg(T)<=2. Therefore binary tree can have 0,1 or 2 children. Some types of binary trees 
        1. Left skewed binary tree 
        2. Right skewed binary tree
